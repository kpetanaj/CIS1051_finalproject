# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

...I want to create a survival adventure visual novel that follows you,
the protagonist, through an innocent-looking but dark fantasy world.
Think of Alice in Wonderland but with evil woodland creatures.
I plan to have [you], a weary sellsword, attempt to spend the night
alone in a cave, and then a night in a strange talking animal's cottage.
[Your] goal will be to deliver a sack of gold to your contractor who
lives in the next town over. There will be multiple points in the game
where you either lose the gold or die, prompting you to restart the game
at a specific "checkpoint". If you make it to your contractor alive, you
win! I plan to import various sprites and backgrounds.


## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

...I will be completing this project alone.


## Do you have any questions of your own?

...How long should the visual novel be? In terms of how long it would take
someone to play it from start to finish. I'm thinking 10 minutes maximum playtime?
