Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

Writing the actual plot script/dialogue/story "choices" for player to make.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

Start coding checkpoints / finding appropriate music (and deciding if I only want one song playing the whole time).

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

RenPy has definitely been a learning curve. Youtube tutorials have helped immensely.
