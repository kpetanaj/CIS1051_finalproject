# CIS 1051 Final Project

I coded a short horror visual novel titled Cat's Cradle. In it, you play as a mercenary beaten
down by a hard day's work. You happen upon a small cottage where you decide to seek lodging.
You are greeted and welcomed in by a kind woman named Mrs. Kitten... but her home is in
complete disarray. The place reeks of decay, and yet Mrs. Kitten dons a clean dress and does
not seem even the least bit fazed at the state of her home. You, the player, are tasked with
surviving the night in Mrs. Kitten's home by choosing the safest options that I, the coder, present you.

# NOTES:
I had a lot of fun storyboarding this project. Unfortunately I was not able to code much (as it took me quite a bit
to familiarize myself with RenPy) and the game ended up rather short because of it, but I'm glad I was able to implement
two distinct story pathways (trusting Mrs. Kitten VERSUS staying cautious of her) as well as one option where the player
dies and is forced to start the game over. The goal was to have at least 3-4 other "do or die" checkpoints.

I also lifted all my background images from random Resident Evil games, so they definitely look out of place if you look
too closely, but I cared more about having the lighting/mood of the backgrounds match with one another and also the sprites.

Thanks for reading (and maybe playing)!
