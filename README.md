# CIS 1051 Final Project

I coded a short horror visual novel titled Cat's Cradle. In it, you are a mercenary beaten
down by a hard day's work, and happen upon a small cottage where you decide to seek lodging.
You are greeted and welcomed in by a kind woman named Mrs. Kitten... but her home is in
complete disarray. The place reeks of decay, and yet Mrs. Kitten dons a clean dress and does
not seem even the least bit fazed at the state of her home. You, the player, are tasked with
surviving the night in Mrs. Kitten's home by choosing the safest options I, the coder, present you.
